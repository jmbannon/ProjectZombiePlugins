# Project Zombie Plugins
Collection of plugins for the upcoming open-source server Project Zombie. Every plugin is under the GNUv3 license.

## Gameplay Overview
We are a modern post-apocalyptic survival server looking for developers and builders. Our goal
is to create a beautiful map and custom plugins to support an immersive,
open world zombie apocalypse unlike any other Minecraft server. We
plan to release our map to the public and await exciting servers and
game modes based on our map!

We are not restricting these plugins' use only to Project Zombie. Each plugin is separate with the intention that it is robust enough to be used for any other server, regardless of its theme.

## Our Message
We are strong advocates for fair, fun, and balanced Minecraft gameplay. We do not condone the current tactics employed by
commercial servers for the sole purpose of profit revenue such as selling over-powered items, pay to be 
unbanned, ridiculously high pricing of cosmetic items, etc. The list goes on.

We strive to build a suite of plugins that can be modified by anyone with hopes that it contributes to 
small, community-ran servers willing to open-source. These plugins will be used by the Project Zombie server 
which will eventually be available to everyone to deploy their own custom instance.

## Interested in Contributing?
Please fork our repository and send a pull request with a meaningful feature/patch/bug-fix. We are always looking for other developers and are willing to help junior developers with the development process.
